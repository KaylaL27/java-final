## âœ¨ OOP Concepts Demonstrated âœ¨

| Principle       | How Itâ€™s Used                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Main classes include `Budget`, `Income`, `Expenses`, `Transactions`, and `Service`. Objects are created for each. |
| **Encapsulation**     | Private fields with public getters/setters in `Budget` ensure data protection.          |
| **Inheritance**       | `Income` and `Expenses` inherit from the `Transactions` abstract class.               |
| **Polymorphism**      | All transactions are stored as `Transactions`. `getType()` is overridden and called polymorphically. |
| **Abstraction**       | `Transactions` is an abstract class that defines a shared interface for child classes. |
